# Budget-Tracker
A VBA macro that creates a worksheet for any month with a simple budget-tracking table. 

On the "CreateNewMonth" sheet within the workbook, click the big, green "Add New Month" button. 

This will check if there exists already a sheet for the current month, then creates a new sheet if it does not already exist.

The sheet will automatically populate with a table for the current month with every day of the month along the top row 
and spending categories in the first column. 

The macro is quite short and simple to understand, so adjust the categories as you would like.
